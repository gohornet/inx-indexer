# INX-Indexer

[![Go](https://github.com/iotaledger/inx-indexer/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iotaledger/inx-indexer/actions/workflows/build.yml)

INX-Indexer is a ledger indexing tool to provide structured and queryable data to wallets and other applications. The indexer maintains its own database separate from that of the node.

## Version compatibility
* `1.x` versions are compatible with Stardust and [HORNET 2.x](https://github.com/iotaledger/hornet)
* `2.x` versions should be used with IOTA 2.0 and [iota-core](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-core).

## Setup
We recommend not using this repo directly but using our pre-built [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/iotaledger/inx-indexer) together with our [Docker setup](https://wiki.iota.org/hornet/how_tos/using_docker/).

You can find the corresponding documentation in the [IOTA Wiki](https://wiki.iota.org/hornet/inx-plugins/indexer/welcome/).
